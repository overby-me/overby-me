# generated wallpapers.

# An integration owns both halves of talking to something: the module that
# knows how to use it, and the pin of what it uses. A tree that takes this
# flake gets both, and a tree that does not never fetches either.
#
# That is the only way a pin can be selective. Flake inputs are resolved from
# a flake.nix before anything evaluates, so a pin can belong to a flake or to
# nothing; making each integration a flake is what lets one be chosen. One
# upstream each, so the name says what taking it costs.
#
# The shape is flakelight-darwin's, which reached it first.
