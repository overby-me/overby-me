# Lower a Ninja build graph (from `rust-ninja -t graph-json`) to Nix
# derivations: one derivation per edge, no import-from-derivation beyond the

#
# Model: a virtual build tree rooted at the Ninja build directory. Every edge
# output has a stable build-dir-relative path (exactly the string Ninja uses).
# Each edge's derivation stages its inputs into a working tree — a producer
# edge's whole `$out` tree is symlinked in (cp -rs, so transitive files and
# symlink targets travel along and large trees are never copied), while source
# inputs are copied as real files so relative `#include` and sibling lookups
# resolve — then runs the fully-expanded command (which references build-dir-
# relative paths) and exports the resulting tree as `$out`. Dependencies flow
# through store-path interpolation in the staging commands only, so an edge
# that merely names a peer's path creates no derivation dependency.
